name: token-economy
description: Use when the user asks to reduce token usage, agent cost, context bloat, prompt-caching misses, RAG/LightRAG behavior, memory policies, or durable instructions. Also use when installing many skills or designing automatic KB recall so retrieval stays bounded.

# Token Economy

- Keep stable instructions in `CLAUDE.md` or skills; keep volatile facts
  in the KB and retrieve them on demand.
- Prefer progressive disclosure: list/search first, open small file
  ranges next, fetch full files or notes only when needed.
- Keep recall bounded: default to `limit=3` for hook-injected context and
  `limit <= 5` for manual task setup.
- Use hybrid retrieval for normal KB recall. Escalate to deep retrieval
  only after a miss, ambiguity, or non-obvious cross-topic dependency.
- Keep runner MCP profiles narrow: `minimal` by default, wider profiles
  only when the task needs those extra tools.
- Do not install or enable low-fit skills just to grow the list. Skill
  metadata itself consumes prompt budget and very large skill sets can
  hide useful skills.
- Preserve prompt-cache-friendly ordering when writing durable
  instructions: stable policy first, dynamic task-specific context later.

When reporting command results, summarize only the lines needed to
support the decision. Session digests should capture only reusable
lessons above a confidence floor and should dedupe against existing KB
hits before writing.
